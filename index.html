			<h3 class="first">Poetic Language</h3>
			<p class="first">
			The mythical creatures of Allingham’s poem are familiar from their introduction. The use of vivid colours to describe their clothing, “Green jacket, red cap”, fulfils the archetypal appearance of these mystic creatures. This familiarity ensures a preconception of these beings as good willed, accentuating their true inner darkness when it is later revealed. This looming transgression is foreshadowed in the second stanza through the revelation that some of these creatures live among the reeds in ‘the black mountain lake’ (14). The colour black has traditionally been associated with evil.<br><br>
 
			Allingham opens ‘The Fairies’ with the isocolon: “Up the airy mountain | Down the rushy glen” (1-2), suggesting that the events of the poem occur in a vast, wild expanse. Hence, as we are introduced to the fairies there is already an indication of their power over humans in this territory in which they coexist. The initial isocolon is shortly succeeded by another: “Wee folk, good folk” (5), to highlight the presupposed “good” nature of fairies. But, the juxtaposition of “good folk” with the narrator’s angst “We daren’t go a-hunting | For fear of little men” (3-4) is conflicting. It defies the preconceived notion of fairies as the virtuous and magical characters we know from popular myth. It is also transgressive that they are characterised as male, further suggesting that they are not typical “fairies”.<br><br>
 
			In the fourth stanza we are introduced to our only named character through the epithet: “little Bridget” (20). The descriptor “little” indicates vulnerability. It contrasts directly with the epithet of the previous character: the “old King” (18) of the fairies. This suggests Bridget’s youth, stressing the atrocity of her kidnap. The use of the collective personal pronoun “We” in the first stanza, aligns us with the human perspective rather than that of the fairies. Then, when we are introduced to the third person perspective in the fifth stanza through the repetition of “they”, a stark contrast is created between “little” Bridget’s innocence and the wicked fairies that have dominated the narrative thus far. The proposal that the fairies “thought that she was fast asleep” (35) does little to combat the tragedy of her death. The fairies are thus condemned by the narrative as perilous and evil in that not only are they responsible for her demise, but this demise is a result of suffering; “with sorrow” (36). The past participle “dead” (36) also emphasizes the certitude of her mortality, whilst the verb “sorrow” suggests it is the loneliness caused by being stolen and withdrawn from human contact that has caused this demise.<br><br>
 
			In the passage that follows it is disclosed that the fairies “have kept her ever since | deep within the lake | on a bed of fig-leaves, | watching till she wake” (37-40), instilling a sinister eeriness to the tone of the poem and emphasizing the demise through the image of a young girl lying lifeless on a lake’s bed. The inertia of this state is juxtaposed against the dynamic verb “watching”, bestowing a perverse quality to the fairies who have instigated this tragedy.<br><br>

			<h3>Rhyme</h3>
			<p>
			William Allingham’s use of rhyme in ‘The Fairies’ is complex, provoking the reader to question the effects that the twists and turns of the rhyme create.<br><br>
			It is firstly convenient to look at the general rhyme scheme in ‘The Fairies’. Allingham, in this respect, is unique in that he both succeeds and fails to adhere to one end rhyme scheme throughout the poem, due to an extension of lines in the middle stanzas (17-40). Both the first two and last two stanzas of ‘The Fairies’ use an extended version of the rhyme scheme ABCB (1-16; 41-56). This rhyme scheme is popular in well-known poetry and songs, such as Hale’s ‘Mary Had a Little Lamb’. The full rhyme scheme for these stanzas, stanzas 1, 2, 5 and 6, is therefore ABCBDEFE (1-16; 41-56). In both stanzas 3 and 4, however, Allingham adds four extra lines, meaning that each of these stanzas’ rhyme schemes is therefore ABCBDEFEGHIH (17-40). This means that, whilst there technically is no one rhyme scheme for Allingham’s poem, audible similarity is retained as every second line ending is part of an end rhyme with another.<br><br>
			The majority of the end rhymes in Allingham’s ‘The Fairies’ are masculine rhymes, in that they only match one syllable. This type of rhyme is used in a great deal of English poetry. Examples in ‘The Fairies’ include “glen” (2) and “men” (4), “home” (10) and “foam” (12) and “sits” (18) and “wits” (20). However, there are some incidents of feminine rhyme in the poem. This is rhyme that matches two or more syllables, with the final syllable being unstressed. We see this occurring with “together” (6) and “feather” (8), “crosses” (22) and “Rosses” (24) and “morrow” (34) and “sorrow” (36). One can question whether these words are used just because Allingham wanted to use them, and the penultimate syllables happened to contain extended vowel sounds, or whether they reflect a change in the content or mood of the poem, as changes in poetic patterns often tend to indicate. Regarding “together” (6) and “feather” (8), one could argue that the words fit into the “trooping” (6) motion of the band of fairies, as when read aloud, the final quartet of the first stanza has an authoritative beat to it. Regarding “morrow” (34) and “sorrow” (36), it could be argued that the lack of stress in the final syllable leaves a mournful tone (36), resonating with the kidnapping of Bridget (29-30), the first specifically dark incident in the poem. The rhyme helps create this, as “morrow”, the coming of morning (34), is conversely often seen as symbolising a new beginning and hope.<br><br>
			There are also forms of general rhyme in Allingham’s ‘The Fairies’. Syllabic rhyme is present in the early lines of the poem in “mountain” (1) and “hunting” (3), allowing the reader to draw on Allingham’s outdoor setting. Assonance is used in “wee” (5) and “green” (7), the first words of both of their respective lines (5; 7), which could help to initially give the fairies a colloquially quaint nature, before going on to reveal a darker side to the popularly friendly creatures. Furthermore, “yellow” (12) and “foam” (12) could be seen as an example of forced rhyme, where the sounds do not completely match but a similarity still exists.<br><br>
			Overall, it is clear that ‘The Fairies’ is a fantastic testament to the complexity and potential of rhyme, and how alterations in patterns of rhyme have implications for meaning.

			<h3>Metre</h3>
			<p>
			In ‘The Fairies’, Allingham uses metre to help the reader visualise the scene, and to enhance the poem’s lyrical properties. The metre is mainly made up of alternating stressed and unstressed syllables. This gives the poem a lilting, rhythmic quality. The musical quality of the work is accentuated by the repetition of the first half of the first stanza as the last stanza, like choruses in a song. The lines are irregular in length, with most between four and seven syllables long, though there are a couple that are eight syllables long.<br><br>
 
			Allingham’s skilful manipulation of metre is clear from the first stanza, especially in the repeated section at the beginning. The first two lines help to set the scene: “Up the airy mountain, | Down the rushy glen”(1). The alternating stressed and unstressed syllables emphasise the length of the long, stressed vowel sounds. The openness of these vowels creates a sense of the openness of the British highland landscape. In the line “Wee folk, good folk” (4), the internal rhyme between “folk” and “folk” is emphasised by the metre, since “Wee folk” and “good folk” are both trochees. The similarity of the two trochees creates a sense of uniformity between the troops, which is enhanced when their actual uniforms are described subsequently. The men are “Trooping all together” (6), and the trochaic trimeter of this line mimics the rhythm of marching. In the next two lines, the metre creates a sense of excitement. In the line: “Green jacket, red cap” (7), a staccato rhythm is created by the two spondees sandwiching an unstressed syllable. When reading it, we are encouraged to move faster, making us feel breathless. This excitement is confirmed by the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence.<br><br>
 
			Allingham continues to enhance the meaning of the poem with the sound and length of his words in the rest of the stanza. The sharp plosives of “crispy pancakes” (11) is contrasted with the long, languorous vowels of “yellow tide-foam” (12). This emphasises the textural differences between the two substances, and adds to the sense of magic, that the bubbles have been transfigured into pancakes.<br><br>
 
			In the third stanza, the tragedy of little Bridget is brought to life with the use of metre.<br><br>
			“They stole little Bridget<br>
			For seven years long;<br>
			When she came down again<br>
			Her friends were all gone.” (29-40)<br><br>
			The spondee on “years long” extends both words in a way that mimics the length of her absence. The near rhyme between “long” and “gone” links the words, and the long, stressed “o” sounds in both, creates a sense of emptiness, emphasising the loss of Bridget.

			<h3>Symbolism</h3>
			<p>
			The use of the “white owl’s feather” in the description serves to emphasize the fairies relationship with the natural world whilst also ties in with the symbol of the sentinel. This is because the owl is associated with stealth and watchfulness. This relation to the owl is repeated throughout the poem with several references to the fairies nocturnal habits such as, “All night awake” , “going up with the music On cold starry nights”. The watchful aspect is also emphasized in the poem with the dead girl Bridget that the fairies keep watch over, “Watching till she wake”.<br><br>
 
			The fairies continue to watch Bridget despite her being dead. This innocence of death shows them to be immortal creatures or symbols of the sublime in the poem. The poem often presents nature as fantastic and powerful, beyond the power or understanding of man, so presenting the fairies as denizens of the sublime is only natural. An example of this is:<br><br>
 
			"Or going up with the music<br>
			On cold starry nights,<br>
			To sup with the Queen<br>
			Of the gay Northern Lights<br><br>
 
			This example establishes the sublimity of nature by associating the northern lights a natural phenomenon with a Queen. This elevates the northern lights to a loftier status helping to add to the sublime feel of this passage. The fact the fairies visit this queen only serves to reinforce their role as denizens of this sublime world because they can move through it in a way that humans cannot.<br><br>
 
			Interestingly the fairies are also a symbol of a pure form of people, innocent of experience unlike man. This is seen in the way that they do not hunt in the poem they live off of “crispy pancakes Of yellow tide-foam”,with “With frogs for their watchdogs”. In this way they are at one with their environment in a way man is not. This innocence in the nature of the fairies parallels genesis and the story of Adam and Eve. But whereas man has been evicted, the fairies still live as creatures of paradise in their own Eden that they must defend. This is emphasized again by Bridget who was stolen by the fairies to live in their world. For seven years. When she was taken she was just “little Bridget”, an innocent child and therefore able to enter the realm of the fairies. But after, ”seven years long”, she was returned to her world by the fairies presumably because she had grown up to the point where she was no longer pure and innocent. In this way the fairies symbolize innocence in the same way that a child does.<br><br>
 
			The defender is another role of the fairy which is central to the poem. “We daren’t go a-hunting For fear of little men”, this is repeated twice in the poem to show the fairies are the defenders of the land. This ties in with the earlier analogy to Eden. The fairies defend their paradise from man who is corrupted by sin and so cannot enter. <br><br>

			<h3>Themes</h3>
			<p>
			The Fantasy World – With the atmosphere of a fable, the poem sheds light on the realms of fantasy and those that live within it. A cinematic introduction is offered by the picturesque language in the openings lines such as “airy mountain” (1) and “rushy glen” (2), which suggests this secret world is one full of movement and magic. The poem reveals life in things that one would presume otherwise dormant, as the fairies live both “down along the rocky shore” (10) and “in the reeds” (14). As a result of this, a message is sent: there is life lurking around every corner. <br><br>
 
			Bad Vs Good – Initially, the fairies appear enchanting and charming. Described in the opening stanza as being “good folk, | trooping all together;” (5-6), the creatures succumb to traditional notions of being friendly – even their clothes consist of a familiar “Green jacket, red cap” (7). However, they are soon associated with wretchedness, causing the child that they steal in the third stanza to lie “dead with sorrow” (37).<br>
			As we are taken on a journey in the poem, it is slowly revealed that the fairies cannot be trusted. The poem moves from the outside, “Up the airy mountain” (1), to inside where they are kept hidden, “through the mosses bare” (42) and “deep within the lake” (38).<br>
			As a result of this movement, the message is clear: no one can be trusted, and even those assumed innocent have darkness within.<br><br>
 
			Naivety – Whilst it is clear that the fairies took the young girl purposefully and spitefully, Stanza 3 describes how they “stole” Bridget (29), the naivety of the fairies keeps them from realising the reality of what they have done. Foolishly, “They thought she was fast asleep, | But she was dead with sorrow” (35-36) and the fairies are still “watching till she wake” (40), not comprehending what they have done. The fairies are unable to understand mortality, their king has lived for so long, “so old and gray” (19), that “He’s nigh lost his wits” (20). Here, the fairies have no understanding of how the human world works, naïve to the truth of their actions. This suggests that the true repercussions of our actions cannot ever be fully understood.<br><br>
 
			Man Vs Nature – Whilst the fairies can be seen as a representation of the fantasy world, they also come to represent nature. Associated with an array of greenery – “reeds” (13), “leaves” (39),”mosses” (42), “trees” (43) – they live in the natural world. The fairies appear actively trying to protect this world, revealed to “have planted thorn trees… is any man so daring | As dig them up in spite?” (43-46). “Man” (45) appears a distinctly ominous figure, shown as large and threatening, in great size contrast to the fairies who are “little men” (4). “Man” (45) is also associated with “spite” and determined to “dig” up their world and ruin the picturesque landscape.<br>
			This conflict sends a strong message... man – stop messing with nature!
