			<h3 class="first">Poetic Language</h3>
			<p class="first">
			Our introduction to the mythical creatures which are the subject of Allingham’s poem, initially remains within a familiar context. The use of simple but vivid colours to describe their clothing, ‘Green jacket, red cap’, fulfils the archetypal appearance of these mystic creatures. This partially familiar image ensures a preconception of these beings as good willed and angelic, accentuating their true inner darkness when it is later revealed. This looming transgression is foreshadowed in the second stanza through the revelation that ‘some’ of these creatures live among the reeds in ‘the black mountain lake’. <br><br>

			Allingham opens The Fairies with the parallelism ‘Up the air mountain/Down the rushy glen’ suggesting that the events of the poem occur in a vast, wild expanse. Hence, as we are introduced to the fairies there is already an indication of their omnipotence over humans in this territory in which they coexist. This initial parallelism is shortly succeeded by another ‘Wee folk, good folk’, to highlight the presupposed ‘good’ nature of fairies. But, the juxtaposition of ‘good folk’ with the narrator’s angst ‘We daren’t go a-hunting/For fear of little men’ is conflicting. It defies the preconceived stereotype of fairies as the virtuous and magical characters we know from popular myth. It is also transgressive that they are characterised as male, further suggesting that they are not typical ‘fairies’. <br><br>

			In the fourth stanza we are introduced to our only named character through the epithet ‘little Bridget’, which indicates vulnerability. This epithet directly contrasts the preceding one used to define the ‘old King’ of the fairies and suggests Bridget’s youth, stressing the atrocity of her kidnap. The use of the collective personal pronoun ‘We’ in the first stanza, aligns us with the human perspective rather than that of the fairies. Then, when we are introduced to the third person perspective in the fifth stanza through the repetition of ‘they’, a stark contrast is created between ‘little’ Bridget’s innocence and the wicked fairies that have dominated the narrative thus far. The proposal that the fairies ‘thought that she was fast asleep’ does little to combat the brutality of her death. The fairies are thus condemned by the narrative as perilous and evil in that not only are they responsible for her demise, but for her demise culminating in suffering; ‘with sorrow’. The past participle ‘dead’ also emphasizes the certitude of her mortality, whilst the verb ‘sorrow’ suggests it is the loneliness caused by being stolen and withdrawn from human contact that has caused this demise. <br><br>

			In the passage that follows it is disclosed that the fairies ‘have kept her ever since/deep within the lake/on a bed of fig-leaves,/watching till she wake’, instilling a sinister eeriness to the tone of the poem and emphasizing the decease through the image of a young girl lying lifeless on a lake’s bed. The inertia of this state is juxtaposed against the dynamic verb ‘watching’, endowing a perverse quality to the fairies who have instigated this tragedy.

			<h3>Rhyme</h3>
			<p>
			William Allingham’s use of rhyme in “The Fairies” is complex, provoking the reader to question the effects that the twists and turns of the rhyme create. <br><br>
			It is firstly convenient to look at the general rhyme scheme in “The Fairies”. Allingham, in this respect, is unique in that he both succeeds and fails to adhere to one end rhyme scheme throughout the poem, due to an extension of lines in the middle stanzas (17-40). Both the first two and last two stanzas of “The Fairies” use an extended version of the rhyme scheme ABCB (1-16; 41-56). This rhyme scheme is popular in well-known poetry and songs, such as Hale’s “Mary Had a Little Lamb”. The full rhyme scheme for these stanzas, stanzas 1, 2, 5 and 6, is therefore ABCBDEFE (1-16; 41-56). In both stanzas 3 and 4, however, Allingham adds four extra lines, meaning that each of these stanzas’ rhyme schemes is therefore ABCBDEFEGHIH (17-40). This means that, whilst there technically is no one rhyme scheme for Allingham’s poem, audible similarity is retained as every second line ending is part of an end rhyme with another.<br><br>
			The majority of the end rhymes in Allingham’s “The Fairies” are masculine rhymes, in that they only match one syllable. This type of rhyme is used in a great deal of English poetry. Examples in “The Fairies” include “glen” (2) and “men” (4), “home” (10) and “foam” (12) and “sits” (18) and “wits” (20). However, there are some incidents of feminine rhyme in the poem. This is rhyme that matches two or more syllables, with the final syllable being unstressed. We see this occurring with “together” (6) and “feather” (8), “crosses” (22) and “Rosses” (24) and “morrow” (34) and “sorrow” (36). One can question whether these words are used just because Allingham wanted to use them, and the penultimate syllables happened to contain extended vowel sounds, or whether they reflect a change in the content or mood of the poem, as changes in poetic patterns often tend to indicate. Regarding “together” (6) and “feather” (8), one could argue that the words fit into the “trooping” (6) motion of the band of fairies, as when read aloud, the final quartet of the first stanza has an authoritative beat to it. Regarding “morrow” (34) and “sorrow” (36), it could be argued that the lack of stress in the final syllable leaves a mournful tone (36), resonating with the kidnapping of Bridget (29-30), the first specifically dark incident in the poem. The rhyme helps create this, as “morrow”, the coming of morning (34), is conversely often seen as symbolising a new beginning and hope.<br><br>
			There are also forms of general rhyme in Allingham’s “The Fairies”. Syllabic rhyme is present in the early lines of the poem in “mountain” (1) and “hunting” (3), allowing the reader to draw on Allingham’s outdoor setting. Assonance is used in “wee” (5) and “green” (7), the first words of both of their respective lines (5; 7), which could help to initially give the fairies a colloquially quaint nature, before going on to reveal a darker side to the popularly friendly creatures. Furthermore, “yellow” (12) and “foam” (12) could be seen as an example of forced rhyme, where the sounds do not completely match but a similarity still exists.<br><br>
			Overall, it is clear that “The Fairies” is a fantastic testament to the complexity and potential of rhyme, and how alterations in patterns of rhyme have implications for meaning.
